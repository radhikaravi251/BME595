## Neural Network developed in HW03
In order to run the python script:  
import torch
from NeuralNetwork import NeuralNetwork
import torch
import sklearn.preprocessing as onehot

The error for training dataset is obtained to be: **10**

I am currently working on the implementation of training for logic gates and will upload a new version soon.
