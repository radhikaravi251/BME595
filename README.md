## Backpropagation
In order to run the python script:  
import torch
from NeuralNetwork import NeuralNetwork
from logicGates import AND
from logicGates import OR
from logicGates import NOT
from logicGates import XOR
img2num.py

The backpropagation works correctly according to the example given in: https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/

I am currently working on the implementation of training for logic gates and will upload a new version soon.
